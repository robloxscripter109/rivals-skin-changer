# rivals-skin-changer
This is a script for rivals that changes your weapons skin (wip rn)

script is semi out its open source and has a couple of dropdowns that dont work atm

tutorial for script, open the lua file copy the code paste it into your executor of choice 

tested executors, xeno dm me if you test your executor if it works i will put it in here

if you dont want to copy and past the lua file just do this
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robloxscripter109/rivals-skin-changer/refs/heads/main/Rivals%20Skin%20Changer.Lua'))()
